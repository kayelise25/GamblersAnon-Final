          IMPORTANT: IF FIRST-TIME USER CLICK HOW TO PLAY BUTTON!!! <br /><br />
          Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the
          highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a hand with a
          higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth
          their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth
          10. An ace's value is 11 unless this would cause the player to bust,
          in which case it is worth 1
